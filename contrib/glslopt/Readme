This is a small sample program to get you quickly up and running, it transforms an input textfile
to an output textfile. The input source textfile should be a fully preprocessed GLSL shader and
the output should be a simple shader in textform.

The project file is generated by BadgerConfig. You also need to fix the errors introduced by not 
forceincluding the file msvccompat.h everywhere (I don't like that practice so I just fixed the code instead)
